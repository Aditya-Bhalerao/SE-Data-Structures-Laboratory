**Group A :-**

###### Experiment No. 2 - 

Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data
Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

###### Experiment No. 7

Write a python Program for magic square. A magic square is an n * n matrix of the
integers 1 to n2 such that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. The
figure given below is an example of magic square for case n=5. In this example, the
common sum is 65.

###### Experiment No. 8

Write a python program that determines the location of a saddle point of matrix if one
exists. An m x n matrix is said to have a saddle point if some entry a[i][j] is the smallest
value in row i and the largest value in j.

###### Experiment No. 9

Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix:
a) Addition of two matrices
b) Subtraction of two matrices
c) Multiplication of two matrices
d) Transpose of a matrix

**Group B :-**

###### Experiment No. 13

Write a python program to maintain club members, sort on roll numbers in ascending
order. Write function “Ternary_Search” to search whether particular student is member
of club or not. Ternary search is modified binary search that divides array into 3 halves
instead of two.

###### Experiment No. 14

Write a pythonprogram to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores.

###### Experiment No. 16

Write a python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display
top five scores

**Group C :-**

###### Experiment No. 19

Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students
of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.
Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of
club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club
member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write
functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

###### Experiment No. 20

The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be
maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start
with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand
a) The list of available seats is to be displayed
b) The seats are to be booked
c) The booking can be cancelled.


**Group D :-**

###### Experiment No. 25

A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically,
punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop”
is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and
observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a
palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the
original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with
functionsa) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

###### Experiment No. 26

In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.

**Group E :-**

###### Experiment No. 29

Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

###### Experiment No. 31

A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a onedimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and
delete elements from either end of the deque.

###### Experiment No. 32

Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
using circular queue using array.
